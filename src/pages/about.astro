          >October 2023: The below statement was written prior to the outbreak
          of the current war in Israel/Palestine. For the statement of 27
          Israeli human rights/anti-occupation organisations, including Standing
          Together, on that war, click <a

        There has never been a greater need for a grassroots movement mobilising
        Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel in pursuit of real democracy:
        full equality for all, including an equal right to self-determination.

              Unending and increasingly violent occupation, accelerated and
              deepened by the most right-wing government Israel has ever seen,
              has fed violence, fear, and hatred between Israelis and
              Palestinians. Social and economic inequality is widening. Israel’s
              Palestinian minority faces increasing discrimination. Women,
              Mizrahi Jews, immigrants, the LGBTQ+ community and others are
              increasingly marginalised — socially, economically, and
              politically.

            <p>
              Settler violence is at an all-time high. Based on the rhetoric and
              actions of the current government, we may well see moves to
              formally annex the West Bank and revoke the citizenship of
              hundreds of thousands of Palestinian citizens of Israel.
            </p>
            <p>
              And yet there is a growing movement which offers hope, in spite of
              the electoral decimation of Israel’s traditional left parties. <a

              > (עומדים ביחד نقف معًا), Israel’s fastest-growing grassroots movement
              over recent years, is uniting Jews and Palestinians within Israel to
              fight for an equal and just society, building a broad coalition of
              diverse communities – Jewish and Arab; Mizrahi and Ashkenazi; people
              of all genders; secular and religious; rural and urban.

              movement, it believes in democracy and equality for all Israel’s citizens.
              Along with other anti-occupation activists, it has raised the need
              to make the struggle for Israeli democracy a struggle against occupation.
